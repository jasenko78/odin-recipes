<h2>Preparation instructions</h2>
<p>Hi all! This is our third recipe for single guys cooking on their own.
    This one is even a bit more demanding, but it is well worth it!</p>
<h2>List of ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 di-go yeast package</li>
    <li>1000 gr flour</li>
    <li>1 glass of warm milk</li>
    <li>spoon sugar</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>250 gr butter </li>
    <li>Seasonings: just some salt</li>
</ul>  
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Take the yeast and mix it in a glass of warm milk and a spoon of flour.</li>
    <li>Mix it all together and wait for it to "rise up"</li>
    <li>Put 1000 gr of flour on the work table, put some salt in it</li>
    <li>Make a hole in the middle, put a fresh whole egg inside</li>
    <li>Also add 2-3 big spoons oil</li>
    <li>Finally, add the yeast mixture by slowly stirring with a spoon</li>
    <li>When mixed together, put it all in a bowl, cover with a kitchen cloth and wait to "rise up"</li>
    <li>When doubled in size, take it out on the working table and stretch it out</li>
    <li>Take a third of the butter and spread it over the dough, fold it over</li>
    <li>Repeat the last step three times</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 250 Celsius</li>
    <li>Put the dough in, and lower the temperature to 220 Celsius and keep it so for 10-15 minutes</li>
    <li>Lower the temperature to 200 Celsius and keep it so for 10/15 minutes</li>
    <li>Lower the temperature to 180 Celsius and keep it so for 10/15 minutes</li>
    <li>Cover the dough with alu foil</li>
    <li>It is done when you knock on it and it has a pounding sound</li>
    <li>Another criteria for "DONE" is when you stick a knife inside, pull it out and nothing sticks to it!</li>
    <li>Serve :)</li>
